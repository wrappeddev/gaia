Lench spent a large portion of his tenure as a Leader of the Clan, leading the clan in both wartime and peace time….his contribution to <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> laid the foundation of everything that <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> is today, and there is no one more qualified to be apart of our very own Legacy Hall. Lench served faithfully as a Courser in his early time within the Clan, Quickly rising to the rank of Commander and later Commissioner; Lench was known for being as Quick with his gun as he was with his words and became known for handling issues by whatever means necessary.

                    One of the only Founders who is still active in the crew a decade later, Terra has served in every rank and at every level possible within the clan. Maintaining a steady position as a Strong and Loyal Advisor and Enforcer TO THIS DAY without failure. Terra has shown every exceptional quality expected of a <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> member with devout loyalty to not only the Leader, The Clan name and reputation, but also the members- her steadfast "no-nonsense" attitude has helped many a member break out of their shell and find their home here. Terra officially retired from an Active Leadership role within the Clan in early 2021 and has since maintained the Rank of "Zealot" and continues to be a prime example of true loyalty in the flesh. I grew up with Terra, we've fought, been enemies, been best friends, and through thick and thin; there is nobody on this earth who I would shed blood faster for than <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span>xTerra.

Bard has long been a Leader of our clan since his days as a Courser, setting the groundwork for the Courser Division…Bard worked for over a Year to get to the Rank of Commander and leading the Largest Courser Division to date with over 21 members in total and then eventually after 2 years of service, made his way to the rank of Commissioner where his talents shined as an Ambassador to other groups, bard has long been the liaison between <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> and other groups on games outside of Red Dead. Under Bard's Leadership, <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has expanded and grown into multiple different gaming franchises and was recognized by many different gaming circles. After Lench stepped down, it was only right that my right hand man be someone who has stood by me through everything <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has been through on Xbox. Bard deserves this spot just as much as everyone else on this list. Imperii Gloria

                    Ivar has long been one of the greatest Instruments of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> success since the VCO Incident. Ivar works his way from the very bottom for over half as a year, serving in the Sentinel Division and setting the groundwork for the division during <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> restoration, and after a long period of serving as a Grunt within the Clan, he eventually took leadership as Commander of the Division after the unfortunate Banning of Ex-Commander Lilith…Ivar took leadership of the Division and lead it with pride and distinction where he eventually earned his Orange name in late 2023, where he was promoted to Commissioner and succeeded by Cowburr who then took his rank as Commander. Ivar has re-established what it means to be a loyal and hardworking individual within the boundaries of this clan. A lot of the work he does is behind the scenes but he also has proven himself to be an established General and leader of troops during battle, Ivar is also one of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> most established leaders…his advice has changed the course of history in many aspects. He has earned his place in our Great hall alongside the other great leaders of this Clan, and as such; on February 1st 2025…during the <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> Conference, he was promoted to President of all <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> Operations on Xbox and given Command of the Entire Chapter…he still continues to lead to this day.

                    Considered by most to be the greatest Courser Commander by far, rivaled by none. Odin has granted his own unique insight into <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> leadership and structure. Being considered one of the most Loyal Commander's to ever grace <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> Halls. His unique approach to training and Division Leadership has shown The Coursers to become to pinnacle of what it means to be a PVP Division under his Guidance. As of 2024, <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> Coursers have achieved what is considered an all-time high on Good PVP Players while Odin retains his role as Commander. Odin joined in 2023 alongside that of Ivar The Boneless and Freydis, and many others that have joined us on our journey. He continues to be one of the greatest Member's <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has to offer, with not only dedication to his Division but the Clan as a whole. The people who have followed in Odin's Footsteps have lead successful paths within <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span>, and many are happy to serve under him. He's a good personal friend of myself and one of our most dedicated members since our re-establishment on all fronts.

                    Probably by far one of the most dedicated and respected Leader's of the Clan's history. Rising through the ranks in 2022, Char rose to prominence within the Instructor Division; leading it to the highest heights the division has ever seen in its history. The Instructor Division under Char's leadership was the best run division of its time, eventually leading to her promotion to Commissioner. Her tenure as Commissioner was a hard fought one, during a rough patch for the Clan; one she fought for with sheer tenacity. Events lead her to leading her own group during this tumultuous period, proving herself as a capable leader and achieving a following of loyal individuals. She eventually returned to the fold in 2023, rising to her previous roles as Instructor Commissioner…responsible for the creation of the policies the instructor Division follows to this day. Her prominence in her division and ability to maintain her composure seen her promoted by Council to Commissioner once again, where she remained until her ascension to Vice-President under Coffee during the first half of 2024. She lead the clan in Coffee's many absences and worked on fixing the Clan's issues. Dedicating time and merit to every goal she set for herself and her peers. She stepped down and became a Zealot in the latter half of 2024, where she remained until the end of the year where she took her post as Commissioner once more. 
                    Char has long been one of the greatest members to ever grace these walls, with her being well loved by members and affiliates alike. Her contributions to the standards of leadership and membership within the Clan will resound through not only the Xbox branch, but other Branches as well.

                    <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> Vice-President for the period of 2022-2023, he has countless contributions to the Clan; earning almost every single medal possible within the Clan. Lench spent a large portion of his tenure as a Leader of the Clan, leading the clan in both wartime and peace time….his contribution to <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> laid the foundation of everything that <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> is today, and there is no one more qualified to be apart of our very own Legacy Hall. Lench served faithfully as a Courser in his early time within the Clan, Quickly rising to the rank of Commander and later Commissioner; Lench was known for being as Quick with his gun as he was with his words and became known for handling issues by whatever means necessary. Imperii Gloria!

                    One of the only Founders who is still active in the crew a decade later, Terra has served in every rank and at every level possible within the clan. Maintaining a steady position as a Strong and Loyal Advisor and Enforcer TO THIS DAY without failure. Terra has shown every exceptional quality expected of a <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> member with devout loyalty to not only the Leader, The Clan name and reputation, but also the members- her steadfast "no-nonsense" attitude has helped many a member break out of their shell and find their home here. Terra officially retired from an Active Leadership role within the Clan in early 2021 and has since maintained the Rank of "Zealot" and continues to be a prime example of true loyalty in the flesh. I grew up with Terra, we've fought, been enemies, been best friends, and through thick and thin; there is nobody on this earth who I would shed blood faster for than <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span>xTerra.

                    One of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> longest standing Xbox Veterans, Bard was the Vice-President of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> going into 2024. Bard has long been a Leader of our clan since his days as a Courser, setting the groundwork for the Courser Division…Bard worked for over a Year to get to the Rank of Commander and leading the Largest Courser Division to date with over 21 members in total and then eventually after 2 years of service, made his way to the rank of Commissioner where his talents shined as an Ambassador to other groups, bard has long been the liaison between <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> and other groups on games outside of Red Dead. Under Bard's Leadership, <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has expanded and grown into multiple different gaming franchises and was recognized by many different gaming circles. After Lench stepped down, it was only right that my right hand man be someone who has stood by me through everything <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has been through on Xbox. Bard deserves this spot just as much as everyone else on this list. Imperii Gloria

                    Ivar has long been one of the greatest Instruments of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> success since the VCO Incident. Ivar works his way from the very bottom for over half as a year, serving in the Sentinel Division and setting the groundwork for the division during <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> restoration, and after a long period of serving as a Grunt within the Clan, he eventually took leadership as Commander of the Division after the unfortunate Banning of Ex-Commander Lilith…Ivar took leadership of the Division and lead it with pride and distinction where he eventually earned his Orange name in late 2023, where he was promoted to Commissioner and succeeded by Cowburr who then took his rank as Commander. Ivar has re-established what it means to be a loyal and hardworking individual within the boundaries of this clan. A lot of the work he does is behind the scenes but he also has proven himself to be an established General and leader of troops during battle, Ivar is also one of <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> most established leaders…his advice has changed the course of history in many aspects. He has earned his place in our Great hall alongside the other great leaders of this Clan, and as such; on February 1st 2025…during the <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> Conference, he was promoted to President of all <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> Operations on Xbox and given Command of the Entire Chapter…he still continues to lead to this day.

                    Considered by most to be the greatest Courser Commander by far, rivaled by none. Odin has granted his own unique insight into <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> leadership and structure. Being considered one of the most Loyal Commander's to ever grace <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> Halls. His unique approach to training and Division Leadership has shown The Coursers to become to pinnacle of what it means to be a PVP Division under his Guidance. As of 2024, <span class="gaia-green">GAIA's</span> Coursers have achieved what is considered an all-time high on Good PVP Players while Odin retains his role as Commander. Odin joined in 2023 alongside that of Ivar The Boneless and Freydis, and many others that have joined us on our journey. He continues to be one of the greatest Member's <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span> has to offer, with not only dedication to his Division but the Clan as a whole. The people who have followed in Odin's Footsteps have lead successful paths within <span class="gaia-green">GAIA</span>, and many are happy to serve under him. He's a good personal friend of myself and one of our most dedicated members since our re-establishment on all fronts.

                    Probably by far one of the most dedicated and respected Leader's of the Clan's history. Rising through the ranks in 2022, Char rose to prominence within the Instructor Division; leading it to the highest heights the division has ever seen in its history. The Instructor Division under Char's leadership was the best run division of its time, eventually leading to her promotion to Commissioner. Her tenure as Commissioner was a hard fought one, during a rough patch for the Clan; one she fought for with sheer tenacity. Events lead her to leading her own group during this tumultuous period, proving herself as a capable leader and achieving a following of loyal individuals. She eventually returned to the fold in 2023, rising to her previous roles as Instructor Commissioner…responsible for the creation of the policies the instructor Division follows to this day. Her prominence in her division and ability to maintain her composure seen her promoted by Council to Commissioner once again, where she remained until her ascension to Vice-President under Coffee during the first half of 2024. She lead the clan in Coffee's many absences and worked on fixing the Clan's issues. Dedicating time and merit to every goal she set for herself and her peers. She stepped down and became a Zealot in the latter half of 2024, where she remained until the end of the year where she took her post as Commissioner once more. 
                    Char has long been one of the greatest members to ever grace these walls, with her being well loved by members and affiliates alike. Her contributions to the standards of leadership and membership within the Clan will resound through not only the Xbox branch, but other Branches as well. 
                    Skal to the beautiful Charmithious the Great!
